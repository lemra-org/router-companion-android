DD-WRT Companion for android (Alpha version - Work in progress)
-------

Had you ever tried to use the DD-WRT web interface on an Android device, you should have noticed how impractical it is to navigate with.

This app aims at making DD-WRT devices management and monitoring a breeze, right from you Android-powered device.
